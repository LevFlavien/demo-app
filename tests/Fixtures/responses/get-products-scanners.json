This is the vision fully realized with the AV36, which is powered by a USB port instead of a wall socket. So now, documents can be scanned whenever a laptop is present, which can be anywhere.\\n\\n<b>Portable</b>\\nThe AV36 is light (only 0.7kg) and small in size at 290mm x 77mm x 52mm. The small form factor enables users to pack along easily without sacrificing too much luggage space or become a burden to carry. Coupled with the benefits of being USB powered, the AV36 sets a new standard for scanner portability.\\n\\n<b>Duplex scanning</b>\\nThe AV36 is a duplex scanner with an optical resolution of 600dpi. Save the time and effort of manually scanning a double-sided document or a plastic ID card. A complete color scan of A4 document at 300dpi in simplex mode takes 12 seconds, and 7.5 seconds per image in duplex mode.\\n\\n<b>Compatible with plastic cards</b>\\nSupported document size ranges from A8 to A4, and it can scan embossed plastic cards up to 1.25mm thick, such as credit cards and ID cards.\\n\\n<b>Bundled software</b>\\nThe newest version of TWAIN (v5.60) and extensive software applications Avision Button Manager, AVScan 5, NewSoft Presto! BizCard and ScanSoft PaperPort 11SE are included with every shipped unit to bring the most out of the AV36.\\n\\n<b>NewSoft Presto! BizCard Presto!</b>\\nBizCard is a complete contact management solution that lets you scan, edit and synchronize business card contacts to various contact management software applications. It captures and converts business cards into a searchable and editable database, with support for 12 different languages including English, most European languages, Simplified/Traditional Chinese and Japanese. BizCard is the ideal tool for helping you stay in touch and organized."
